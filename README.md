Prerequisite
------------

The following binaries should be available:
- useradd
- usermod
- base64
- curl
- docker-compose
- sudo
- tar
- unxz

The scripts rely on a system running **systemd**.

Installation
------------

- Create the installer: `make`
- Copy the `capp-installer` file to your host target.
- Execute it with **root privilege** and by specifying the **default hostname** and **email address** to use for the `proxy` (email is used for *let's encrypt*):  
`capp-installer example.com user@example.com`

Be sure to have your `sshd` service up and running.

Configuration
-------------

Users allowed to upload *DCA* files should have their public keys in `/etc/compose/dca/users-keys`.
For more information see the [dca readme](dca/README.md).

Users allowed to act on deployments should have their public keys in `/etc/deploy-authorized-keys`.
You don't have to do anything after modifying this file for the content to be taken into account.

Admin usage
-----------

All actions should be done under the **`compose`** account.

To switch to it, use `su -s /bin/bash --login compose` from `root` account.

Main scripts are `compose-dirs` and `capp`.

Usage
-----

Two ssh servers are running on the node: one for administration and deployements (port 22), one for transfering *Docker Compose Archives* (port 122).

### Transfering a DCA and its signature

If you have your public key allowed, you could transfer a *dca* file and its signature to *node* by doing something like:

`scp -P 122 my.dca* dca@node:`

### Deploy

`ssh deploy@node deploy /home/deploy/dca/my.dca [clean] [nostart]`

This will verify the file, extract it, install docker images, docker-compose config file, systemd service and start it.  
If `clean` is provided, any pre-existing volumes will be deleted prior deploy.  
If `nostart` is provided, the system service will not be started. This let you the chance to hack into before starting it.

This will exit with `0` status if deploy was ok, greater number in case of error.

### Undeploy

`ssh deploy@node undeploy my_app integ [all]`

This will stop the docker services, remove the systemd service, delete docker-compose files and images.  
If `all` is provided, then all related images and volumes will also be deleted.  
Be careful, volumes may contains data not backuped!

This will exit with `0` status if undeploy was ok, greater number in case of error.

### Start, Restart, Stop, Status, Logs

See `ssh deploy@node help` for an exhaustive list of all actions and options.

### Hacking as admin

If you can log into *node* and change to the `compose` account or your account is in the `docker` group:

- Go into you app and environment folder, containing `docker-compose.yml` file, for instance `cd myapp/prod` from `compose` home dir.
- Then use any `docker-compose` command, like `exec` to enter a container.

âš  Keep it mind that the compose app is handled by a systemd service so **don't start or stop** the compose while the service is running.  
Better use the `capp start|stop` commands or `sudo systemctl start|stop` commands.
